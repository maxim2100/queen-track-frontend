# 🔧 Fix for Queen Track Frontend Redirect Loop Issue

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Both your staging (http://162.55.53.52:3002/) and production (http://162.55.53.52:3001/) URLs are showing "The page isn't redirecting properly" error due to a **redirect loop** in the Nginx configuration.

## ✅ Solution

The issue is with the `try_files` directive in your Nginx configuration. The current configuration:

```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
```

causes redirect loops with React Router.

## 🚀 How to Fix (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Upload Fixed Configuration Files

Run these commands from your project directory:

```bash
scp nginx-production.conf root@162.55.53.52:/tmp/
scp nginx-staging.conf root@162.55.53.52:/tmp/
```

### Step 2: SSH to Your Server

```bash
ssh root@162.55.53.52
```

### Step 3: Apply the Fix

Once connected to your server, run these commands:

```bash
# Backup current configs (optional but recommended)
cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/queen-track-production /etc/nginx/sites-available/queen-track-production.backup
cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/queen-track-staging /etc/nginx/sites-available/queen-track-staging.backup

# Apply new configurations
cp /tmp/nginx-production.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/queen-track-production
cp /tmp/nginx-staging.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/queen-track-staging

# Test nginx configuration
nginx -t

# If test passes, reload nginx
systemctl reload nginx

# Clean up temp files
rm /tmp/nginx-production.conf /tmp/nginx-staging.conf
```

## 🧪 Verify the Fix

After applying the fix, test your applications:

```bash
# Test health endpoints (should work)
curl http://162.55.53.52:3001/health
curl http://162.55.53.52:3002/health

# Test main pages (should no longer redirect loop)
curl -I http://162.55.53.52:3001/
curl -I http://162.55.53.52:3002/
```

## 🔍 What Changed?

The fixed configuration uses:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ @fallback;
}

location @fallback {
    rewrite ^.*$ /index.html last;
}
```

Instead of the problematic:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

## 📋 Current Status

- ✅ Health endpoints: Working (http://162.55.53.52:3001/health, http://162.55.53.52:3002/health)
- ❌ Main pages: Redirect loop (needs fix)
- ✅ Nginx: Running
- ✅ Applications: Deployed
- ✅ CI/CD: Fixed for future deployments

## 🎉 After the Fix

Your applications will be available at:

- 🌐 Production: http://162.55.53.52:3001/
- 🌐 Staging: http://162.55.53.52:3002/

The CI/CD pipeline has also been updated to prevent this issue in future deployments.
